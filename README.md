# A simple ROS Action server in C++

Lightweight waypoint following for the TurtleSim in ROS

## About

This project comprises three ROS ([Robot Operating System)](http://www.ros.org/) packages:

* The `cpp_controller` package is the meat of the project.
It contains a simple action server, written in C++, for having a robot do 2D waypoint following.
* The `cpp_controller_msgs` defines the `WaypointFollowing` action interface.
* The `py_controller_client` is there to house a simple Python action client to the C++ server.
